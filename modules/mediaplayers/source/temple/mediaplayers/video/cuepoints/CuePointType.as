		 * new scene in a video clip. (Note that you can't jump forward in a Flash Video clip unless that
		 * portion of the FLV file has already downloaded, as is the case with progressively loaded FLV files.
		 * If you are streaming Flash Video content with a Flash Communication Server or Flash Media Server,
		 * you can seek forward without waiting for all segments between the current playhead time and the
		 * seeked-to point to download.)

		 * This type of cue point is revealed only to ActionScript handlers you build in your own code.
		 * (Note that you can detect both types, navigation and event, in ActionScript handlers.) An event
		 * cue point, however, is one that you specifically don't want to be revealed to the navigation
		 * controls for your video content. For example, if you want a scene title to be removed before the
		 * next scene title appears, you can use an event cue point to mark the time when the text should be
		 * cleared. The addition and removal of captions for speech could also be handled by event cue points,
		 * as speech captions are not necessarily chapter or scene points within the video clip.
