	 * This class contains all possible values for timeline labels used by the <code>ButtonTimelineBehavior</code>.
	 * 
	 * <p>There is a frame label for every status of a button. There is also a frame label to define the timeline
	 * animation to enter this status. There is also a frame to define the timeline animation to leave this status.
	 * After the enter animation is played, the timeline stops on the frame of the current status.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Check out the following schema for the available frame labels for every status.</p>
	 * 
	 * <table class="innertable">
	 * 	<tr>
	 * 		<th>button state</th>
	 * 		<th>enter animation label</th>
	 * 		<th>stops at label</th>
	 * 		<th>exit animation label</th>
	 * 	</tr>
	 * 	<tr>
	 * 		<td>over</td>
	 * 		<td>in</td>
	 * 		<td>over</td>

	 * 		<td>blur</td>
	 * 	</tr>
	 * </table>
	 * 
	 * <p>The default label (when none of these above labels applies) is 'up'. If there is no enter and exit label on
	 * the timeline, and there are no other labels between the 'up' label and the current state label, the
	 * <code>ButtonTimelineBehavior</code> will play the timeline forwards and backwards between the up label and the
	 * state label when the button has this state.</p>
