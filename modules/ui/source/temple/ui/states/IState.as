	/**
	 * A 'IState' is a DisplayObject which visualize a specific state of his parent, like 'over', 'down' or 'selected'.
	 * 
	 * <p>If the parent gets this specific state all children which represents this state will be shown, by calling the 'show()' method.
	 * If the parent object loses the state all children of this state will be hidden, by calling the 'hide()' method.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>Note that the parent object can have multiple states at once and that a single state can be represented by multiple 'state' children.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>You need to call the show() and hide() method yourself or you could use the StateHelper to do it for you.
	 * Some Temple classes like buttons and form components do this automatically.</p>
