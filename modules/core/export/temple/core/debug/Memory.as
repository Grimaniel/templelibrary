	 * This class is used for Memory management. If <code>Temple.registerObjectsInMemory</code> is enabled, all Temple 
	 * objects are tracked in this class.
	 * 
	 * <p>The main reason for sites and games slowing down are memory leaks: objects that aren't properly removed from
	 * memory when they are no longer needed. The Temple was build to prevent this, and offers tools to solve this
	 * problem.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>The Memory uses a weak reference for storing objects. Therefor this class is useful for tracking down
	 * possible memory leaks. If you have destructed an objects, but the object is still in Memory, you might have a 
	 * memory leak.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p>You can use the <code>MemoryDebugger</code> for debugging your application for memory leaks.</p>
