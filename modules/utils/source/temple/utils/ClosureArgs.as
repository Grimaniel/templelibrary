	 * ClosureArgs
	 * AS3-style DelegateArgs: useful to pass parameters to a callback when you can't.
	 * 		
	 * @example
	 * <listing version="3.0">	
	 * myAction.callback = ClosureArgs.create(someObject.method, [1, 2, 3]);
	 * </listing>
	 * 	
	 * you also could keep an instance for re-use (with destructAfterCall = false)
	 * 
	 * @example
	 * <listing version="3.0">		
	 * var ca:ClosureArgs = new ClosureArgs(someObject.handler, [1, 2, 3], false);
	 * myAction.callback = ca;
	 * </listing>
	 * 			
	 * Don't forget ca.destruct() to kill references!
