	 * Quick way to send a message to the <code>Log</code> class.
	 * 
	 * @param message the message which is sent to the Log.
	 * @param object an object wich is added to the message. The object will be added with all his properties, using the
	 * 	<code>dump()</code> method.
	 * @param depth indicates the depth of recursion of the properties of the object. If set to 0 only the properties of
	 * 	the object will be added, if set to 1 also the properties of each property will be added etcetera.
	 * @param duplicates a Boolean which indicates if duplicate objects in the properties of the object should be added
	 * every time the object occurs (<code>true</code>) or only should be added once and ignored for the other occasions.
	 * @param level the level of the log message. Possible values are "error", "warn", "debug", "info", "fatal" and
	 * 	"status".
	 * 
	 *  @example
	 * <listing version="3.0">
	 * 
	 *  log("myObject", myObject);
	 * 
	 * </listing>
