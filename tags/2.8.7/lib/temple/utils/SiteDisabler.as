	 * <p>After calling SiteDisabler.disableSite() all MouseEvents are blocked.</p>
	 * 
	 * <p><strong>Why should you use it</strong></p>
	 * <p>If you do not want the user to click on anything. For instance when the application is busy and clicking

	 * <p>Call SiteDisabler.disableSite() to disable all MouseEvents. Call SiteDisabler.enableSite() to enable the MouseEvents</p>

	 * <listing version="3.0">
	 * SiteDisabler.disableSite(); // all MouseEvents are now disabled
	 * 
	 * SiteDisabler.enableSite(); // all MouseEvents are now enabled
