	 * Since Flash player 9 has a huge problem with removing unnecessary objects, it's really hard to remove object from
	 * Memory. Destructing objects is one of the key-features of the Temple. If you enabled object registration in the main
	 * Temple class. You can track your objects in Memory. If you destruct the objects they should disappear after a garbage
	 * collection.</p>

		 * 
		 * If you want the object to be available for garbage collection make sure you:
		 * <ul>
		 * 	<li>Remove all event listeners on this object (use <code>removeAllEventListeners</code> on Temple objects).</li>
		 * 	<li>Remove all event listeners from this object.</li>
		 * 	<li>Set all non-primitive variables to null.</li>

		 * 
		 * When a Temple object is destructed a <code>DestructEvent.DESTRUCT</code> is dispatched from the object
		 * (if the object implements <code>ICoreEventDispatcher</code>).
		 * 
		 * <p>Note: Bear in mind that it is possible an object can be destructed more than once.</p>

		 *		// if (this.stage) this.stage.removeEventListener(KeyboardEvent.KEY_UP, this.handleKeyUp);
		 *		
		 *		// It is not necessary to destruct DisplayObject, they get destructed automatically. Only set the
		 *		// reference to null
		 *		this.mcMovieClip = null;
